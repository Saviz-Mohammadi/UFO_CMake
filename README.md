# UFO_CMake

This is a very simple CMake template project which enables the setup of a C++ project. Please bear in mind that while this project isn't flawless, it's designed to help new programmers establish C++ projects swiftly and effectively. We plan to periodically enhance its features, so stay tuned for updates. We hope you find it valuable!


### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following set of tools installed on your personal machine before attempting to use this template:

```diff
CMake                         (Minimum version required is 3.30.0)
A C++ compiler of your choice (MSVC, MinGW, GCC, Clang, ...)
Git                           (For the FetchContent command to work in CMake)
```


### Optional

This template supports additional tools that can be very helpful in your development. However, they require some software to be installed. Of course this is completely optional and you can ignore them if you wish to:

```diff
Doxygen                       (For generating documentation for your project)
Clang-Format                  (For formatting your files)
```


### Usage

This template provides a nice little documentation file that you can open in your web browser. This documentation provides explanation for the template. To open this file, follow these instructions:

```diff
UFO_CMake (folder) >> documentation (folder) >> documentation.html (file)
```
