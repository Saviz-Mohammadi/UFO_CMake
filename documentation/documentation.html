                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">ABOUT</span><br>
                    In today's era of computer development, it can be very challenging to get a C++ project up and running easily. There are numerous platforms, each with their own set of preferred toolchains, commands, and structures for creating software and projects based on C++. If we want to add external dependencies and other requirements to the mix, the situation can quickly become overwhelming. Despite the amazing capabilities of CMake, we can still encounter frustrating situations and problems that can be very specific and difficult to resolve. For this reason, I wanted to create a CMake template that could handle most beginner to intermediate requirements with minimal hassle.
                </p>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    Please keep in mind that this template is not perfect, and I did my best to create a clean and useful structure. However, creating the "perfect CMake" that can handle every situation is very difficult and nearly impossible to achieve. As a result, I had to establish some rules for my template. First and foremost, this template aims to make as many components as static as possible. This includes our own custom libraries, third-party (external) libraries, and even compiler-based libraries and dependencies, to achieve a truly static executable or artifact without running into dependency errors. I tested the template as much as possible, but please keep in mind that imperfections may still exist.
                </p>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    Secondly, I tried to set up the environment in such a way that internal libraries we create can automatically detect any third-party (external) libraries we may have linked against. Some programmers may disagree with or dislike this architecture, preferring to link against only the libraries they deem necessary. However, keep in mind that this is just a friendly template aimed at making things uncomplicated and easy. Lastly, this template does not enforce any specific toolchain, compiler, or environment. The overall architecture was designed to be as friendly as possible with all platforms. However, remember that we cannot make any guarantees.

                </p>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    This template also provides testing with the Catch2 library. Some people may prefer using gtest or other frameworks for testing. However, through experimentation, we found that Catch2 is the most flexible framework, creating the least amount of issues and errors, and it is compatible with most platforms and toolchains. We encountered numerous issues when setting up gtest, which is why this template is shipped with Catch2 in mind.
                </p>

                    A few other small key details are required to be specified clearly as well, such as selecting the target toolchain and platform along with any special arguments for building the project. This section will guide you through these steps. This documentation includes sections below for each available toolchain, their recommended platforms, and the essential options and arguments. Please note that these represent only a subset of available concepts and options, and are the most important ones. For a comprehensive list, refer to the official <a class="link" href="https://cmake.org/documentation/" target="_blank">CMake documentation</a> or use the following command in your terminal:

                <h2>Architecture</h2>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>
                
                
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">OVERVIEW</span><br>
                    This template employs an <span class="highlight">out-of-source</span> architecture with CMake. If you're unfamiliar with this approach, it means that the source and build folder locations are kept separate. This separation simplifies maintenance and interaction with the template by keeping build artifacts in a different location from the source files. This organization ensures cleaner project management and easier navigation. Let’s take a closer look at each folder.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <div class="spacer-topic"></div>




                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">SOURCE</span><br>
                    The source folder is the core of the template, as programmers will primarily interact with its contents. This folder includes the following components: the root CMakeLists.txt file, the cmake_scripts folder, the internal_libraries folder, the resources folder, and the unit_tests folder. Let’s explore each of these elements in detail, starting with the simpler components and gradually moving to the more complex ones.
                </p>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    We begin with the root CMakeLists.txt file, which serves as the backbone of the entire template. It contains the overarching architectural and design script, most of which typically does not require modification. However, an important aspect of this file is the set of configurable options located near the beginning. These options can be modified either when invoking CMake or directly within the script. Additionally, you can customize the project's name and description at the top of the file.
                </p>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    The second component is the cmake_scripts folder, which contains a collection of CMake scripts that provide additional functionality and features used by the root CMakeLists.txt file. In most cases, there is no need to modify or interact with the contents of this folder. However, if you have specific requirements or wish to add custom scripts for your own use cases, you can make changes here.

                </p>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    Next is the internal_libraries folder. By design, nearly all the code you write in this template will be organized as internal library modules. To create a new module, you can copy the existing factory library, modify its contents, and update the CMakeLists.txt file inside it. This approach encourages programmers to think more clearly and establish well-defined boundaries between different parts of their code.
                </p>
                
                
                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    The resources folder is designed to provide a dedicated space for storing all the assets your program may rely on, such as text files, JSON files, XML files, images, icons, and other resources. The folder's structure and file organization will be preserved exactly as they are when copied to the final executable's location. This ensures a straightforward way to reference your resources within the final program.
                </p>
                
                
                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    Last but not least is the unit_tests folder, which contains all your unit test source code. It follows a similar structure to the internal_libraries folder. To create a new unit test, simply duplicate the existing factory unit test, modify its contents, and update the corresponding CMakeLists.txt file. After compiling your project, all unit tests will be placed in a folder named tests alongside the executable.
                </p>




                <div class="spacer-topic"></div>




                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">BUILD</span><br>
                    The build folder is where all build artifacts, including unit tests, are stored. If you're using CMake directly from the command line or through a development environment, you're good to go. However, for added convenience, we've included helpful utilities in the build_tools folder, located alongside the build folder. These tools provide customizable toolchains and scripts to simplify running CMake and generating your project. For more details, refer to the <a class="link" href="#Build" target="_self">Build</a> section.

                    Remembering all the arguments and commands for building a CMake project can indeed be quite challenging. To alleviate this, we have developed platform-specific command-line helper tools located in the <span class="highlight">"build_tools"</span> folder. Each platform includes a <span class="highlight">"config.json"</span> file where you can conveniently configure your build arguments. These arguments will be simply copied over to the CMake executable. Once you have customized your build settings to your preference, you can initiate the generation and build process with a single command:

                    If you decided to use this template for your CMake projects, then you're in luck because running tests is built-in using the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2" target="_blank">Catch2</a> library. However, manually executing terminal commands to instruct CMake to run tests can be cumbersome. Therefore, we've developed a convenient utility that allows you to run tests directly from the terminal with ease. This tool is included in the <span class="highlight">"build_tools"</span> folder, per each operating system. Simply navigate to the respective folder and execute the script as follows:

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">DESCRIPTION:</span><br>
                    The MSVC toolchain stands for <span class="highlight">"Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler"</span>, which contains a suite of tools including a compiler, linker, build system, resource manager, and more. These tools are primarily designed for and available exclusively on the Windows operating system. If you are using a Linux or MacOS machine, utilizing this toolchain can be either impossible or very challenging. This restriction is also why terms like "MSVC", "Visual Studio IDE", and "Windows" are often associated with each other, as they are closely interlinked.
                </p>




                <div class="spacer-topic"></div>




                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">INSTALLATION (Windows):</span><br>
                    MSVC is currently exclusive to the Windows operating system. You have two installation options. You can either download the toolchain completely standalone by referring to the <a class="link" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools" target="_blank">standalone installation</a> link, or you can use the complete suite provided alongside the <a class="link" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools" target="_blank">Visual Studio IDE installer</a>. Whichever method you choose, make sure to select the category of <span class="highlight">"C++ for Desktop development"</span> once the installer launches. This component will ensure that everything you need for developing C++ software is available to you.
                </p>




                <div class="spacer-topic"></div>




                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">MAKING TOOLCHAIN VISIBLE TO CMAKE:</span><br>
                    After installing the toolchain on your machine, you need to ensure it is visible to CMake for generating your projects. The simplest method is to add the entire installation directory to your system's PATH. This allows CMake to automatically locate all necessary tools. This action is different from one platform and OS to another. You need to refer to the documentation section of your specific operating system to figure out how to add a certain tool to the system PATH.
                </p>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    Alternatively, you can add your installation folder's path to the list of paths that CMake will search to find your tool. To add multiple paths, separate them with a semi-colon (";") like this:
                </p>

                    <span class="highlight">SPECIFYING GENERATOR (BUILD-SYSTEM):</span><br>
                    A generator or build system is a scripting language shipped with each toolchain to streamline the process of compiling, linking, and generally building your project. It enbales developers to save their instructions in a build-script. It will then use this script to communicate with the compiler, linker, and other necessary tools on your behalf. MSVC utilizes <a class="link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/?view=vs-2022" target="_blank">MSBuild</a> as its underlying build system. Visual Studio projects and solutions also take advantage of this build system behind the scenes. To instruct CMake to use this generator, specify the desired version of Visual Studio using the following command:
                </p>

                <div class="spacer-code-title"></div>

                    <code>

                </div>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    To obtain a comprehensive list of available names for your generator on your system, execute the <span class="highlight">"cmake --help"</span> command. As you scroll down, you'll eventually come across a section that mentions "Generators". In that section you will find the names of all the generators that are currently supported on your platform. Keep in mind that just because they are supported, does not mean that they are installed. Here is an example of how to select MSVC (Visual Studio):
                </p>

                <div class="spacer-code-title"></div>

                <p>
                    This action will also inform CMake that you intend to utilize the MSVC compiler, linker, and other associated tools from this toolchain, as they are highly compatible with this generator or build system. Some other generators or build-systems allow you to interact with other toolchain compilers, linkers, and tools. However, MSVC is very strict and does not allow this.

                    The GCC tool chain stands for <span class="highlight">"GNU Compiler Collection"</span>. <a class="link" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GCC</a> is a suite of compilers and tools developed by the GNU Project. It is widely used for compiling C, C++, and other programming languages mostly on Unix-based platforms including Linux, and MacOS. Despite the fact that GCC can be used on both Linux and MacOS platforms, but it is mostly adopted by the Linux community. As a result it is only natural to assume that when we talk about GCC, then the target platform in question is most likely Linux.

                    <span class="highlight">MAKING TOOLCHAIN VISIBLE TO CMAKE:</span><br>
                    After installing the toolchain on your machine, you need to ensure it is visible to CMake for generating your projects. The simplest method is to add the entire installation directory to your system's PATH. This allows CMake to automatically locate all necessary tools. This action is different from one platform and OS to another. You need to refer to the documentation section of your specific operating system to figure out how to add a certain tool to the system PATH.
                </p>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    Alternatively, you can add your installation folder's path to the list of paths that CMake will search to find your tool. To add multiple paths, separate them with a semi-colon (";") like this:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please note that on Unix platforms, files are often distributed across multiple locations based on their intended use and functionality. As a result, in most GCC installations, these locations are typically already added to the PATH or automatically detected by CMake.

                    The GCC toolchain can be used and built with various build systems. The most widely used build system for GCC are <a class="link" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html" target="_blank">Makefiles</a>, which are shipped by default with the toolchain. To obtain a comprehensive list of available names for your generator on your system, execute the <span class="highlight">"cmake --help"</span> command. As you scroll down, you'll eventually come across a section that mentions "Generators". In that section you will find the names of all the generators that are currently supported on your platform. Keep in mind that just because they are supported, does not mean that they are installed. Here is an example of how to select GCC with the build system as "Unix Makefiles":

                    GCC operates as a single-configuration toolchain, requiring you to specify the desired build configuration upfront. You cannot switch between different configuration types during development. To define the configuration, use the <span class="highlight">"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE"</span> argument. If you need to develop with a different configuration type, you must create a separate build folder using CMake from the beginning. This allows you to include or exclude specific configuration types as needed for your project:

                    <span class="highlight">DESCRIPTION:</span><br>
                    The MinGW tool chain stands for <span class="highlight">"Minimalist GNU for Windows"</span>. MinGW is a port of GCC for Windows. It includes necessary utilities and libraries to facilitate native Windows development using GCC. As a result of this, when developers use the word "MinGW", then we can safely assume that the target platform is Windows. MinGW is highly similar to GCC in almost every aspect. Therefore, concepts applicable to GCC also apply seamlessly to MinGW. <a class="link" href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/" target="_blank">MinGW-w64</a> is the newest project of MinGW that aims to bring more functionality and support to Windows.

                    The latest iteration of the MinGW project, known as <span class="highlight">"MinGW-w64"</span>, incorporates the newest features from GCC. You can download the binaries directly from the <a class="link" href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/" target="_blank">official MinGW-w64 page</a>. From personal experience, the best approach is to download the binaries from the <a class="link" href="https://winlibs.com/" target="_blank">WinLibs.com</a> option offered by this page. On the WinLibs page you must scroll down to the <span class="highlight">"Release versions"</span> section to obtain the installers.

                    <span class="highlight">INSTALLATION (MacOS):</span><br>
                    While MinGW is traditionally used for building Windows applications on Windows systems, it is possible to use this tool to create a cross-compilation environment. This enables us to compile Windows executables on non-Windows platforms such as MacOS. For MacOS, the recommended method to install MinGW is through the <a class="link" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew package manager</a>, where you can find the appropriate command on their website by searching for the keyword <span class="highlight">"mingw-w64"</span>.

                    MinGW operates as a single-configuration toolchain, requiring you to specify the desired build configuration upfront. You cannot switch between different configuration types during development. To define the configuration, use the <span class="highlight">"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE"</span> argument. If you need to develop with a different configuration type, you must create a separate build folder using CMake from the beginning. This allows you to include or exclude specific configuration types as needed for your project:

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">DESCRIPTION:</span><br>
                    The Clang toolchain project originated from Apple in 2007 as part of the <a class="link" href="https://llvm.org/" target="_blank">LLVM</a> project (Low Level Virtual Machine), aiming to replace GCC as the default compiler. Known for its modular design, Clang offers enhanced error messages and diagnostics compared to GCC. Although Clang is not limited to Apple platforms and supports Linux and Windows as well, it is often associated with Apple among developers.

                    <span class="highlight">SPECIFYING GENERATOR:</span><br>
                    The Clang/LLVM toolchain is cross-platform, making it compatible with various build-systems. However, from my experience, it performs optimally when paired with the <a class="link" href="https://ninja-build.org/" target="_blank">Ninja</a> build-system generator. Simply specifying Ninja as the generator isn't sufficient to ensure Clang is automatically used, as other installed toolchains may be prioritized by CMake. Therefore, you must provide specific arguments to CMake for the compiler, linker, and other necessary settings. Below is the command you should use:

                    <span class="highlight">ARCHITECTURE SELECTION</span><br>
                    One crucial consideration for Clang/LLVM is selecting the architecture. To specify the target architecture, one must pass the correct flag to the C++ compiler itself. As a result, in CMake you can specify the architecture to the compiler of the Clang/LLVM toolchain by using the <span class="highlight">"-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS"</span> argument. Below are some of the available architectures, each accompanied by a brief description:
